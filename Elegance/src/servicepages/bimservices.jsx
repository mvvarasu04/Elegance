         <p>At Elegance geo infotech, we know that it is important to optimize processes,
           data and tools to increase productivity in the construction industry.</p>

           <p>Our integrated approach of BIM and Geo database model for large 
            infrastructure planning projects helps improve the quality, 
            time and cost of projects.</p>

         <p>To meet the demand for better work in less time, Architecture, Engineering and Construction stakeholders 
          want accurate building information. BIM is much more than just 3D visualization; it rather provides 
          a complete process for creating and managing a building. It is a digitally supported process for planning, 
          constructing and operating buildings. Understanding the customerâ€™s 
          requirements and specifications with a focus on details allows the delivery of projects within budget and on time.</p>
